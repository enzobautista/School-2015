  Hexadecimal
  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
  10h (hexadecimal)=16
  hexadecimal notation: 32A ADD (F1B) (221)
  1011 1111 ->8 bits
  1011 1111-> BF hex -> 8 bits
  count in steps of four from RIGHT to LEFT
  1BFA3300H->32 bits
  Two famous word lengths:
    -32 bit: pentium
    -64 bit: i3, i5, i7
  Mnemonics
    -ADD: 8 bits
  Operands
    -12 bits, 12 bits
FDOES
  -F: MAR, MDR, IR, PC
  -D: ID
  -O: MAR, MDR, General Purpose Registers
  -E: ALU, Z
  -S: MAR, MDR 
FDOES
 FDOES
  FDOES
   FDOES
  -ODF-> Problem since F and O happening at the same time at the same clock cycle
    -Both need MAR
    -In one clock cycle only one read can be done
    -Structural Hazard
      -Restructuring
    -Add another MAR and MDR
  -FE conflict 
    -Add another ALU
CS 150: Part 2-D: Survey of Processor Architecture
  Review:
    -FDOES->FDES
    -Redundancy can solve structural hazards
    -But sometimes redundancy is not enough
    -Our CPUs are finite machines
  ----------------------------------------------
  -Microprocessors in the market
    -what's the difference?
    -many options: amd, intel
  -Areas of development
    -technologies which can be improved in CPU design:
      -System bus speed
      -Internal and external clock frequency
      -Casing
      -Cooling system
      -Instruction set
      -Materials used for the die
    -end result: enhance speed of the CPU and the system in general
