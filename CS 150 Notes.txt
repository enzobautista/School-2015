Computer Architecture
Burst
	-Voltage is strong enough for the CPU to perform operations
Cycle
Overclocking
	-ex. 1.2 GHZ to 1.4GHZ
	-reconfiguring the machine to run faster than the recommended clock cycles
Main Memory 
	-Not a monolithic
	-divided into separated cells where data resides in
	-ex. Instruction 5x3 it has to locate the 5, 3, and the instruction (instruction, data  in locations)
	-CPU references main memory to get the data and instructions (kuha, get, fetch referencing)
		-Copies are made 
		-updating algorithms  process of updating the original one due to a change
	-Each location has a name addresses
		   001    002   003    004    005
	-80-20 rule or 90-10 rules
		-locality of reference
			-two types of locality
				-Temporal Locality
					-Recently accessed items are likely to be accessed in the near future (pinakarecent??)
				-Spatial Locality
					-Items whose addresses (or location) are near one another tend to be referenced close together in time
Benchmarks
	-run them and find out if good or bad and how good and how bad
	-4 types
		-Synthetic benchmark
			-Fake programs trying to match behavior of real applications
			-ex. Program to create load of 100 withdrawals instead of getting 100 people to withdraw
			-Can configure systems to work well with that benchmark (pwedeng lokohin)
CPU Organization
300 MUL (312) (444) 
312 is implicit operand
312<-(4)
444<-(6)
4 is an explicit operand
FDOES
F-Fetching the Instruction (know address of instruction first)
D-Decode (CPU will now understand the meaning of the instruction)
O-Operand Fetch
E-Execute
S-
CU: Control unit “issues control signals”, either MEM Read or MEM right
MAR
MDR->IR
ID
Assembly and Machine Language
  Hexadecimal
  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
  10h (hexadecimal)=16
  hexadecimal notation: 32A ADD (F1B) (221)
  1011 1111 ->8 bits
  1011 1111-> BF hex -> 8 bits
  count in steps of four from RIGHT to LEFT
  1BFA3300H->32 bits
  Two famous word lengths:
    -32 bit: pentium
    -64 bit: i3, i5, i7
  Mnemonics
    -ADD: 8 bits
  Operands
    -12 bits, 12 bits
FDOES
  -F: MAR, MDR, IR, PC
  -D: ID
  -O: MAR, MDR, General Purpose Registers
  -E: ALU, Z
  -S: MAR, MDR 
FDOES
 FDOES
  FDOES
   FDOES
  -ODF-> Problem since F and O happening at the same time at the same clock cycle
    -Both need MAR
    -In one clock cycle only one read can be done
    -Structural Hazard
      -Restructuring
    -Add another MAR and MDR
  -FE conflict 
    -Add another ALU
CS 150: Part 2-D: Survey of Processor Architecture
  Review:
    -FDOES->FDES
    -Redundancy can solve structural hazards
    -But sometimes redundancy is not enough
    -Our CPUs are finite machines
  ----------------------------------------------
  -Microprocessors in the market
    -what's the difference?
    -many options: amd, intel
  -Areas of development
    -technologies which can be improved in CPU design:
      -System bus speed
      -Internal and external clock frequency
      -Casing
      -Cooling system
      -Instruction set
      -Materials used for the die
    -end result: enhance speed of the CPU and the system in general
