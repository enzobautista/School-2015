Authentic Human Rights VS Spurious …
Authentic
1.	Inherent in humanity
2.	Are tied to those goods…
3.	Inalienable, cannot be removed from the human person
4.	For the integral good of the human person
5.	At the service of the dignity of the person who possesses the right
6.	Demandable Forbearances against the rest of humanity. Hence protection is due to the holder of rights—the human person
7.	Obligation to give it
8.	Edifies and Dignifies both the holder of the right and the person who accords him the right
9.	An Authentic human right serves the good of the human community
Spurious Liberties
1.	Created to rationalize certain acts contrary to human nature
2.	Destroy the human person
3.	Not demandable
4.	Hence there is no injustice in refusing to acknowledge them
5.	Destroy and degrade both the receiver and giver
6.	Harms the community
Hence
1.	Civil authority can only acknowledge and affirm inherent rights as they are, by nature, already there
2.	Are alien to human nature
