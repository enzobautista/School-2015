SA21 Notes
 Sociological Imagination: The ideas of C. Wright Mills
 Seeks to understand the larger historical context on which seemingly personal events are experienced; finding how people construct meanings out of these experiences introspectively (inner-life) and as members of society
  		-Takes into account how individuals become falsely conscious of their social positions;
  		-Searches for framework of a modern society, taking into account the meaningful everyday life experiences that the people as individuals, and as a collective deal with;right now is a relatively new concept. 
  			-We are in a modern society since the way we currently live
  			-The mere fact that we are identifying ourselves as a nation is a modern concept. 
  			-Almost all other nations in the world have a mix of traditional and modern
  			-The mere idea of tradition is a modern idea (the concept of modern and traditional can only arise when we have an idea of what is "modern" and what is not)
  		-Endeavors to understand the social psychology emerging from the constitution of a modern society;
  			-Before the concept of nationality there was no sense of belongingness (national consciousness)
  			-It is possible to see emerging concepts (ex. utang-na-loob)
  				-Discovered in the 1950's (people gained a consciouness of this "trait")
  				-ex. notion of Pinoy pride
  				-These are products of our modern relationships|a process mediated by the social networks that we carve
  		-Investigates how and why certain individuals explicitly entangle themselves into trouble or take an indifferent position on broader social problems.
  			-why social individuals are lured into corruption, crimes, anti-social behavior... etc
  				-These are seen by Sociology as events which are not isolated
  				-these are shared by others; therefore these are affected by social phenomenon
  				-to make sense of what it is in society that dictate these trends
  				-things that sociologists consider in studying social phenomenon
  	Acquiring Sociological Imagination
  	"thinking oursleves away" from the familiar routines of our daily lives to look at them anew
  		-C.Wright Mills
  			-intersection of biography and history
  			-private issues (private problems and private joys), public troubles 
  				-ex. day in day out workers who go to work everyday suffer having to line up to ride the MRT->bad performance of public transportation
  				-ex. Suffering of a child-> Money that should have been spent in public health are lost due to corruption
  		-timelines, cohort analysis
  			-Analysis the generation->cohort
  			-ex. looking at the timeline before the social network may give us insights on what occurs in social networks
  		-social categories/groups as a unit of analysis
  			-ex.class, age (ex.1-17), middle class, upper class, internet time usage (ex.1-2 hours)
  			-If you group people we are able to retrieve an understanding of the patterns of social behavior
  		-leves of analysis
  			-micro(small groups, community)
  			-meso/institutional(family,religion,etc)
  			-[see written notes]
  		-Tools of the trade: Concepts, Theories, Perpectives, Scientific Methods/Studies and Evidence
  			-Concept: ex.identity| [things that are not physical]
  			-Theories: ex.connectedness; people even from faraway places are connected
  			-Perspective: Comes from concepts and theories ex. Marxist perspective-> marxist concepts and theories used in analyzing the situation in Payatas
  			-Scientific Methods: ex. interviews, immersions
  			-Evidence: data, retrieved through scientific methods, analyzed through concepts and theories
  		-Unit of analysis: Groups and their social categories
  			-age groups-young, middle, adult
  			-sex/gender-male/masuline, female/feminine
  			-income class-ABCDE of Social Weather Station
  			-religious groups-Roman Catholic, Protestant, etc
  	ex.Of how sociology analyzes social phenomenon
  		-Why Typhoon Haiyan is No Exception
  			-First World Countries are mostly responsible for Climate Change but it is the Thirld World Countries who experience the effects of their pollution
  			-The lifestyle of people in the more developed countries are responsible for climate change
  			-The aid they are offering does not justify the damage caused
  	Sociological Imagination in the Philippines
  		-Sociology as a by-product of American colonialism
  			-takes a structuralist ad functionalist approach in social analysis
  				-Filipino values, reciprocity, interpersonal relationships
  			-alleged as an American neo-colonial tool
  		-Plays a critical role in critical periods of post-colonial Philippine history
  			-critique of Marcos dictatorship, political repression, growing social inequality
  			-pays attentions to massive population growth and its impact to resources
  			-draws attention to mass poverty
  			-investigates and offer policy interventions on matters
  	Sociological and Anthropological Theories
  		-What is a social theory?
  			-General idea of how phenomena are to be explained;
  			-Statement about the human condition;
  			-Explanations have to be proven with empirical evidence
  		-Why is theory necessary?
  			-To establish a framework of understanding social phenomena;
  			-Produce a body of knowledge that explains social phenomena;
  			-Theories are not isolated statements of the human social condition;
  				-ex.theories on class may be linked to theories on race
  				-ex.ethnicity theories may be linked to theories on employment
  			-Theories are part of the body of knowledge generated by generations of scholars
  	-Early theorising of social phenomena
  		-Plato and Aristotle (5th century BC)
  			-Plants and animals form a single, graded continuum going from more perfection to less perfection
  				-ex. God...humans...animals
  		-Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778)
  			-Classified plants in a "systema naturae"
  			-Heirarchical classification scheme in descending order
  	-18th century Theorising of social phenomena
  		-Jean Baptist Lamarck
  			-Adapting for survival
  				-occurs due to daily engagement with nature
  				-ex.Giraffe
  		-George Cuvier (18th century)
  			-Theory of catastrophism
  			-Quick series of catasthrophies accounted for changes on earth and the fossil record
  			-Cataclysm and upheavals (eg.Noah's flood) killed of previous sets of living creatures, replaced by new creations
  		-Charles Lyell (1726-1797)
  			-Questioned catastrophism
  			-Offered a theory of uniformism: Natural forces constantly shape and reshape Earth over a vast stretch of time
  			-Published the principles of geology
  			-geology and paleontology
  		-Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913)
  			-Rejected the idea that each species was created at one time in a fixed form
  			-Evolution of species through natural selection
  			-Darwin published the Origins of Species by Means of Natural Selection
  				-There is variation in traits
  				-Differential in reproduction
  				-There is heredity
  				-Evolution takes place
  	-19th century theories os Social phenomena: Social Evolutionism
  			-Culture and society develop or progress in a uniform and progressive way
  			-Most societies pass through different stages, progressing towards a common end
  		-Edward Tylor (19th century)
  			-Culture evolves from simple to complex
  				-Savagery (stone age,primitive), barbarism (iron age), to civilization (empires, kingdoms, slavery)
  				-like a staircase
  				-"diffusion" of culture from one society to another
  		-Lewis Henry Morgan
  			-Family evolved in six stages
  				-Society began as a horde of people living in promiscuity;
  				-Group of brothers married to a group of sisters; brothers and sisters were allowed to mate [family to family]
  				-Group marriages were practiced but brothers and sisters were not allowed to mate
  				-Loosely paired male and female lived with other people
  				-Husband-dominant family; husbands can have more than one wife simultaneously
  				-Age of civilization: distinguished by a monogamous family
  		-Diffusionism
  			-British diffusionist thinkers: Elliott Smith, William Perry, W.H.R. Rivers
  				-Borrowings inventions of one culture from another;
  				-Human contact caused the filtering of cultural traits into another culture;
  			-American diffusionist thinkers: Clark Wissler, Alfred Kroeber
  				-what is widely distributed must be the oldest or earliest trait
  				-the must be regional cultural centers from which the characteristics of other cultures 
  			-The problem with Diffusionism
  				-Unable to answer why society accepts, rejects or modifies a certain cultural trait
  					-ex. Agricultural tools
  						-when they brought back the plow from western countries, other countries modified it
  				-Inadequate in answering why particular traits develop in center and why not elsewhere
  		-20th century: Historical particulism and cultural relativity
  			-Franz Boaz (1858-1942)
  				-critiqued social evolutionist assumption that universal laws determined all human culture
  					-social evolutionists lacked sufficient data to formulate any assumption and generalization;
  					-Universal laws are premature because of the complexity of human variation
  					-Human variation
  						-biological characteristics of people depend on where they grew up
  				-Cultural relativity
  					-Culture has to be studied in the context of the society in shich they appeared
  					-there is a need for the collection of as many data on cultures as possible since they might disappear due to the advent of of industrialization
  				-Problem with cultural relativity
  					-Does not really address aspects of culture that violates human integrity or human rights
  						-ex.divine right of kings
  						-ex.executions through beheadings
  						-ex.subjugation of women
  		-Debate
  			-Theories must be theory based and concept driven
  	Racial Ideology: The White Man's Burden
  		-19th century ideology that argued for European role in enlightening the 'dark' corners of the world towards civilization
  		-The term was taken from the title of a poem written by Rudyars Kipling, author of the jugnle book and the foremost advocate of the ideology
  	Manifest Destiny
  		-The belief that the United States should assume the European role of 'enlightening' and bringing the 'dark' corners of the world into civilization and Christianity
  		-Used in justifying American colonization of the Philippines
  	Limits of Biological Approach to Understanding Human Social Behavior
  		-By demonstrating variations between the human qualities created in different societies, anthropology has often tried to show that there are large areas of human existence which biology cannot acount for fully
  	Human Potential: Cultural or Biological
  		-We are limited by our environment
  		-Anthropology focuses on the social and cultural dimensions as weel as uniformities between discrete forms of human life
  		-Cultural factor: technology
  		-Biological: what we can survive 
  		-Culture and Biology
  			-culture is not itself biological but it rests in certain features of human biology
  		-Nature and Capacity of Human Beings
  			-Human beings are social products
  			-From infancy humans are directed to other human beings as the signficant feature of their environment
  			-The truly human in us
  				-Is made by our engagements with the social and cultural world
  				-It is neither exclusively individual nor naturalbiology
  	Social expectations (Norms)
  		-shared conventions
  		-most social conventions are taken for granted and are therefore perceived to as natural
  		-Implicit and written convention
  			-ex. of written: handbook
  		-Across time these conventions are just arbitrary
  	Human Variation: Nature or Culture
  		-Human Nature Vs Human Culture
  			-Nature
  				-1 it is a biological fact that humans need food to grow and to survive
  				-2 people need to reproduce
  			-Culture
  				-1 food is prepared and eaten in a culturally determined way
  				-2 people look at marriage in different ways
  		----------------------------------------------------
  		Culture[Cultural Universals][Cultural Variations]
  		Nature[Genetic Universals][Genetic Differences]
  				     Sharing		    Variation
  		----------------------------------------------------
  			-What makes us human is to share in the universals and practice the variation
  			-is to share both biology and culture
  	Key Concepts in Sociology and Anthropology: Human Variation and Socialization
  		-Sociology and Anthropology are built on the backs of Philosophy
  		-Cultural Variation and Adaptability
  			-Cultural means of adaptation
  				-ex. hunting and gathering-> food production
