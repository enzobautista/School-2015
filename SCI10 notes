	Innovation and Technology Vs Social Changers| Pottier
		-Technology becomes a social changer when it becomes socially acceptable
		-Technology learns how to make decisions for us-> create debates on ethics| ethical grey area
		-Technology: Human application of knowledge to making tools and the use of natural resources
		-Technology is all about application and use
			-to extend our capablilities and minimize our limitations
			-applied science
			-the totality of means employed by a people to provide itself with the objects of material culture
		-Social Changer
			-1 A little bit unstructured, think outside the box
			-2 Common sense
			-3 Right place at the right time-> Serendipity
			-4 Social Acceptability
				-To make something socially acceptable we need marketing
		-Science Vs Technology
			-Science concerns with itself knowing why-> value judgement |ethics
			-Technology concerns itself with how
		Science and technology and its impacts on society
			-Intended and Unintended
			-Can be evaluated after the fact
	3 Waves of Technology
		-Alvin toffler
		-Comparison of 3 waves:
			-Energy
			-Distribution of goods/ travel
			-Family Structure
			-Education/information
			-Power Structures
		-First Wave 1089
			-Wave: Agriculture
			-Tool: Plough
			-Accomplishments: domestication of plants, animals
			-Energy: Renewable
			-distribution of goods: limited
			-education: oral tradition
			-power structure: land ownership
			-How they choose which plant to domesticate
				-seed size, dispersal mutations, lack of bitterness, early germination, fiber length
			-Domesticated animals
				-Cows, pigs, horse, goat, sheep
					-easier to tame
					-Herd mentality: tame the leader
			-Power Structure
				-Elite->peasants, slaves, workers
					-Social structure was not mobile
		-Second Wave: Industrial Revolution 1600's
			-Tool: steam engine
			-Energy: coal, fossil fuels
			-Movie that depicted it: Around the world in 80 days
			-Factory system: Assembly line
				-workers performed only one task
			-the idea of having more than needed due to commodities becoming cheaper started here
			-newspapers
			-education and information: formal education, many more sources of education
			-child labor->children's rights->education
			-Mass production, mass consumption, mass education, mass communication, mass destruction
			-mass destruction->mining
			-colonization->resource extraction and exploitation
				-glory, gold, and God
			-travel/distriution of goods: it exists
			-family structure: slightly smaller
			-science->1700's-1800's| Information became vast
				-more difficult to become an expert in a field
				-renaissance men
			-power structures->secular governments
		-Third Wave: Information Age
			-Energy: Primarily fossil fuels
			-distribution of goods and travel: Instantaneous, very fast, online shopping
			-family structure: complicated
			-education: formal education has become more recognized
			-information: extremely vast, what we need are experts on finding things
			-power structure: people have a lot more power
		-Overlapping waves exist
	Proceeding
    	-Interactions between research, legislation, research, stakeholders, programs and policies
    Environmental Change
    	Dimensions
    		-Nature and degree of the change
    			-physical, chemical, biological
    			-direct vs indirect
    			-natural or fabricated
    			-isolated vs synergistic
    			-reversible vs irreversible
    		-Geographic Scope
    			-local
    			-regional
    			-global
    			*trans-territorial
    		-Time scale
    			-temporary
    			-permanent
    			-intermittent
    			-continuous
    			-seasonal
    		-Economic and Socio-cultural Impact
    			-Behavior needs
    			-Development 
    				-ex. some change may have more impact on less developed countries and less impact on more developed countries
    	Investigation
    		-Physical evidence
    			-"prima facie"
    			-source/cause
    		-Chemical analysis
    			-qualitative
    			-quantitative
    		-Bioassay
    			-net effect
    				-does it have an effect
    			-bioavailability
    				-how much of a substance enters a body
    		-Impact
    			-modelling
    				-show the relationships
    				-environmental science
    					-it is the framework for understanding and decision-making
    				-dynamic
    					-the environment is very dynamic
    					-the model should account for a changing environment
    			-PRP
    				-system dynamic model
    				-Population Resources and Pollution
    					-variables
    					-they form one system
    					-factors/stocks
    						-Affected/affecting
    						-direct or inverse
    						-feedback: when affecting becomes the affected
    						-Population as a factor
    							-the amount of species/individuals in a certain area
    							-not just about absolute size
    							-distribution
    							-density
    							-rate
    							-behavior
    						-Resources
    							-distribution
    								-how they are spread out
    								-natural dispersion of things
    							-allocation
    								-how they are used
    								-more controlled type of distribution
    							-renewable
    							-non-renewable
    						-Pollution
    							-anything that destroys the integrity of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of the environment
    							-too much of something in the wrong place or at the wrong time
    							-diffuse
    							-point
    			-Environment and Development
    				-people think of development as growth
    					-more products, more profit, faster ROI
    					-economic view on nature
    	Water Management in the Philippines
    		-Distribution
    		-Consumption
    		-Availability
    		-Problems and solutions
    	Have your Cake and Eat it
    		-Case study
    		-The world faces tremendous challenges to feed a growing, richer world population
    		-Research statement: How do we get resources to feed the population
    		-Framework: look for frameworks (ex. Doc Sio's)
    		-2 levels we can influence
    			-our own lifestyle
    			-our governmentedit /etc/default/rcS
